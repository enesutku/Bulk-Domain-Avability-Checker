# Bulk-Domain-Avability-Checker

1) Install Node.js

Before you can use this bot, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the installer for your operating system from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

2) Obtain an API key

To use the WhoisXMLAPI Domain Availability API, you need to obtain an API key from the WhoisXMLAPI website. You can sign up for a free trial account to get a limited number of API requests per month, or you can purchase a subscription for more requests. Once you have an API key, replace the "paste your api here" placeholder in the JavaScript code with your actual API key.

3) Prepare a list of domain names

Create a plain text file that contains a list of domain names, with one domain name per line. Save this file with a .txt extension, for example domains.txt.

Make sure the domain names are in a valid format, for example:

example.com

google.co.uk

apple.com

4) Run the JavaScript code

Open the command window and type: node check.js

All results will appear in seconds.
